      <description>The July meetup is a wrap! Our 4th corona time online meetup was another great success. We had 45 participants showing up to listen to a great talk about CVE hunting, hacking along with one of the medium difficulty machines and finishing off with the reading of Miffy at the Zoo.
CVE Hunting Melvin gave his first public presentation today. He just finished his OSWE certification and in the process found a CVE in an open source project.</description>

      <description>Introduction Diversity and inclusion make our community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.
Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful and friendly community for everyone.
This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behaviour occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behaviour has the potential to adversely affect the safety or well-being of community members.</description>

      <title>Moderation Guidelines</title>

      <description>Introduction It is important that all users’ questions, answers and comments are in line with the Hack de Wereld Discord Code of Conduct, as well as with the category and topic, or channel, they belong to. When deciding to approach a user, moderators and administrators must always assume intentions are good, which is usually the case. Over-moderation is harmful to the atmosphere of the community and should be avoided.
Expectations for moderator enforcement While in practice most actions from moderators and administrators will be friendly reminders, they should act on complaints/reports quickly and involve other team members if necessary.</description>

      <description>The June meetup is a wrap! Our community is growing and we are getting to know each other quite well. A very cool thing to see is that the same people keep showing up, most have been around since the 1st meetup back in April!
The meetup started off with a presentation by Leandro (ceso). After passing his OSCP certification last month I asked him to share some of his thoughts on what you should do to get started.</description>

      <description>Last night we had our first official Wednesday Hackday meetup. It was a great success with 25 people showing up to learn about Hack The Box and hacking in general. The meetup was Virtual due to the Corona Measures in place across the country.
The meetup started with some introductions and a getting started message by Sotiria from Hack The Box. It is great to be part of the Hack The Box family of meetups.</description>
