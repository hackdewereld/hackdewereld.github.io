      <description>Sometimes your pland just doesn&amp;rsquo;t work. This time we were supposed to have Shaun come back to show us the TenetTwo machine, but at the last moment he was unable to make it.
Luckily we had @sheeraz join us at the last possible moment to guide use through the retired machine called Heist. The walkthrough was done through the CTF platform and was done in a most excellent manner! Thank you @sheeraz for joining us at the very last moment.</description>

      <description>We have existed for 1 whole year! Even though all the meetups have been done during the pandemic they all have been quite awesome to hold/present/look back at. We met so many nice people in our community that the effort of organizing the meetup is well worth it!
At this meetup we had @egre55 and @makelaris join us, together with @SinisterMatrix to talk about HTB and answer questions from the audience.</description>

      <description>We walked through the steps to own Delivery. My wish for @T13nn3s to do more walkthroughs came true as he was kind enough to host this one as well.
Recordings As the machines is active at this time the recordings of the meetup are held back. Once Delivery retires the recording will be made available.</description>

      <description>WOW! What a meetup. This time we had 2 active machines being demoed by 2 amazing presenters.
Shaun / egotistical The first presentation was done by the one and only @egotistical. He has created many machines that many of us have tried. Today he showed how to work through his latest creation named Tenet. He explained the backstory, how he tried to build the machine around the movie with the same name and the many clues that lead up to the eventual ownage of the machine.</description>

      <description>The first meetup of the new year was also a very busy one. Almost 90 people RSVP&amp;rsquo;d to the event. The event is still being hosted on discord, with presentations (and anything requiring screen sharing) through YouTube, as discord can not handle such a significant load.
Advent of CTF As most of the members of the meetup also participated in the Advent of CTF it was a much requested topic for this month&amp;rsquo;s meetup.</description>

      <description>The meetup is still growing! Just this week we passed 200 humans on our discord server. We have been very actively playing Advent of CTF and the discussions are very active. The members esp0xdeadbeef and JustRelax decided to sponsor the discord with a Boost, many thanks for that! Our member Jorian showed us his animation skills and created a server animation to go with the new boost status!
The meetup had Ian Austin return.</description>

      <description>This meetup was all about binary exploitation. Our community member Alexandru took us through Assembly, Shell Code and Buffer overflows. We looked at the basics of assemblies, the registers that you will commonly find and how a C program translates to assembly.
After the presentation we had a small quiz. Just to do something different then listening to technical talks and to determine who should get some prizes. In the end we were able to give away 3 VIP passes and a 1 month Pro Labs subscription.</description>

      <description>The 7th meetup is a wrap. This entire meetup was focused on a single thing: a CTF. Our community member @danielyc had created a cool CTF for his dayjob and they were willing to share it with us!
This meetup things were different. Instead of Zoom we used discord and youtube to connect with people. We already use discord extensively for our community during meetups. When using Zoom all the coordination falls to a single person; the organizer.</description>

      <description>We are halfway through our first year of existance! During the pandemic we have started a meetup and have been growing bigger every edition! At this point the meetup brings together about 50 people from over the dutch (and international) industry and enthousiasts that want to get started with hacking.
Stuff goes wrong Sometimes stuff just goes wrong. Last meetup the emails from meetup.com were blank when I mailed out the passwords to the meetup and this week it seems a number of guests did not receive the email or it was delivered to their spam.</description>

      <description>Vacation time is over, but we are still all at home due to the Corona Virus. This does not stop us from having yet another great meetup! 45 people gathered to listen to a great talk / Q&amp;amp;A and competed in a game of trivia with amazing prizes. The night was closed out with the traditional reading of a Miffy story.
Ian Austin / egre55   Ian talked to us about the thoughts behind content development at Hack The Box.</description>

CVE Hunting Melvin gave his first public presentation today. He just finished his OSWE certification and in the process found a CVE in an open source project.</description>

      <title>Moderation Guidelines</title>
      <link>https://hackdewereld.nl/modguide/</link>

      <description>Introduction It is important that all users’ questions, answers and comments are in line with the Hack de Wereld Discord Code of Conduct, as well as with the category and topic, or channel, they belong to. When deciding to approach a user, moderators and administrators must always assume intentions are good, which is usually the case. Over-moderation is harmful to the atmosphere of the community and should be avoided.
Expectations for moderator enforcement While in practice most actions from moderators and administrators will be friendly reminders, they should act on complaints/reports quickly and involve other team members if necessary.</description>

      <description>The June meetup is a wrap! Our community is growing and we are getting to know each other quite well. A very cool thing to see is that the same people keep showing up, most have been around since the 1st meetup back in April!
The meetup started off with a presentation by Leandro (ceso). After passing his OSCP certification last month I asked him to share some of his thoughts on what you should do to get started.</description>
