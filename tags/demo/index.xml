      <description>WOW! What a meetup. This time we had 2 active machines being demoed by 2 amazing presenters.
Shaun / egotistical The first presentation was done by the one and only @egotistical. He has created many machines that many of us have tried. Today he showed how to work through his latest creation named Tenet. He explained the backstory, how he tried to build the machine around the movie with the same name and the many clues that lead up to the eventual ownage of the machine.</description>

      <description>The meetup is still growing! Just this week we passed 200 humans on our discord server. We have been very actively playing Advent of CTF and the discussions are very active. The members esp0xdeadbeef and JustRelax decided to sponsor the discord with a Boost, many thanks for that! Our member Jorian showed us his animation skills and created a server animation to go with the new boost status!
The meetup had Ian Austin return.</description>
