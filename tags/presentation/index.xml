      <description>We are halfway through our first year of existance! During the pandemic we have started a meetup and have been growing bigger every edition! At this point the meetup brings together about 50 people from over the dutch (and international) industry and enthousiasts that want to get started with hacking.
Stuff goes wrong Sometimes stuff just goes wrong. Last meetup the emails from meetup.com were blank when I mailed out the passwords to the meetup and this week it seems a number of guests did not receive the email or it was delivered to their spam.</description>

      <description>Vacation time is over, but we are still all at home due to the Corona Virus. This does not stop us from having yet another great meetup! 45 people gathered to listen to a great talk / Q&amp;amp;A and competed in a game of trivia with amazing prizes. The night was closed out with the traditional reading of a Miffy story.
Ian Austin / egre55   Ian talked to us about the thoughts behind content development at Hack The Box.</description>

      <description>The July meetup is a wrap! Our 4th corona time online meetup was another great success. We had 45 participants showing up to listen to a great talk about CVE hunting, hacking along with one of the medium difficulty machines and finishing off with the reading of Miffy at the Zoo.
CVE Hunting Melvin gave his first public presentation today. He just finished his OSWE certification and in the process found a CVE in an open source project.</description>

      <description>The June meetup is a wrap! Our community is growing and we are getting to know each other quite well. A very cool thing to see is that the same people keep showing up, most have been around since the 1st meetup back in April!
The meetup started off with a presentation by Leandro (ceso). After passing his OSCP certification last month I asked him to share some of his thoughts on what you should do to get started.</description>

      <description>We had our 2nd meetup last night. Again a large group of Hack The Box friends showed up and we had a great time! We hit a milestone just before the meeting with a whopping 300 members in our Hack The Box NL group on meetup.com.
The theme for the meetup was Reverse Engineering. There was a presentation by Arjen on getting started with the reverse engineering challenges on Hack The Box.</description>
