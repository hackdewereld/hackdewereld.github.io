      <description>We had our 2nd meetup last night. Again a large group of Hack The Box friends showed up and we had a great time! We hit a milestone just before the meeting with a whopping 300 members in our Hack The Box NL group on meetup.com.
The theme for the meetup was Reverse Engineering. There was a presentation by Arjen on getting started with the reverse engineering challenges on Hack The Box.</description>

      <description>Last night we had our first official Wednesday Hackday meetup. It was a great success with 25 people showing up to learn about Hack The Box and hacking in general. The meetup was Virtual due to the Corona Measures in place across the country.
The meetup started with some introductions and a getting started message by Sotiria from Hack The Box. It is great to be part of the Hack The Box family of meetups.</description>
